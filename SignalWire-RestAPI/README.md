SignalWire-RestAPI version 1.2
===========================

SignalWire::RestAPI is a flexible, extensible API for SignalWire written in
Perl. It's primary objective is reliability and robustness for
SignalWire's RESTful API. The module should survive any future updates to
the API without any changes whatsoever.

Make any SignalWire API call in two lines of code:

    ## make a SignalWire object
    my $signalwire = new SignalWire::RestAPI( AccountSid => '(PROJECT KEY)',
                                     AuthToken  => '(TOKEN)',
				     API_URL    => 'https://SPACE.signalwire.com');

    ## retrieve calls I've made
    $response = $signalwire->GET('Calls');

    ## place a new call to 801-123-5555 from 403-123-1234
    $response = $signalwire->POST('Calls',
                              From => '4031231234',
                              To   => '8011235555',
                              Url  => 'http://example.org/cgi-bin/signalwire');

    ## see account information
    $response = $signalwire->GET('Accounts');

    ## see details for a specific call
    $response = $signalwire->GET('Calls/CA42ed11f93dc08b952027ffbc406d0868');

    ## send an SMS message
    $response = $signalwire->POST( 'Messages',
                               From => $from,
                               To   => $to,
                               Body => $body );
